## SDK Integration

See our Technical Documentation for instructions on integrating Braze into your React Native application.
- [iOS Documentation](https://www.braze.com/documentation/React_Native/iOS/)
- [Android Documentation](https://www.braze.com/documentation/React_Native/Android_and_FireOS/)

## Running the Sample App

The following commands apply to both sample projects and use the `AppboyProject` directory as an example.

```
cd demo-angular/
npm install
```

### iOS
Our sample app integrates the native Braze iOS SDK through [Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

From the `demo-angular` directory:
```
tns run ios
```
From the `src` directory:
```
npm run demo-angular.ios
```

### Android
From the `demo-angular` directory:
```
tns run android
```
From the `src` directory:
```
npm run demo-angular.android
```
